# `UNICORNZipExport`

Access data generated by ÄKTA chromatography systems within Python.

## What problem does it solve?

The UNICORN 7 control program required by ÄKTA systems
supports bulk export of chromatography data as `.zip` files.
These files contain a mixture of XML and unlabelled binary data
which makes it hard to access the data from the actual experiment.

`UNICORNZipExport` reads in such Zip files
and presents the chromatography data through (my best attempt at) a user-friendly interface.
With this you can run further analyses of the chromatography data in Python,
such as plotting or something more complex.

## Alternatives

[PyCORN](https://github.com/pyahmed/PyCORN)
seems to support files produced by older versions of UNICORN too,
in addition to a web service for plotting.

## Dependencies

* Python 3
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/)

## Usage

Use any method that points Python to `unizipex.py`,
*e.g.*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nejmeijer/unizipex
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD/unizipex
```

Assuming the data from UNICORN is saved as `chrom_data.zip`,
you can now do things like the following in Python:

```python
from unizipex import UNICORNZipExport

data = UNICORNZipExport('chrom_data.zip')
# pathlib is also supported

# X and Y data from the first UV sensor, for example
key = 'UV 1'
vol, amp = data.readout[key].measurements

# some metadata
vol_unit, amp_unit = data.readout[key].units
_, all_fractions = data.fractions

# There is more than just 'UV 1'
available_readouts = data.readout.keys()

# for information on all functionality run
help(UNICORNZipExport)
```
